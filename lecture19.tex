\begin{parag}{Motivation Chanel Model}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The internet oftern drops packets due to congestion
        \item Not all the bits on a storage device can be retrieved
        \item \important{Wireless signals are very noisy}
    \end{itemize}
    We consider two types of channel models:
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1]{12025-04-29.png}
    \end{center}
    So for the first $0$ let us say we throw a dice, if the outcome is $6$, we will replace the outcome by a question mark or we won't. Therefore, here we can say that the erosion probability is $\frac{1}{6}$.\\
    However maybe the eraser is not random, maybe someone who know what we're gonna do (the algorithm to find the erasure) will find the one that will be a question mark.
\\
Here the channel input alphabet is not necessarily binary.\\
We can take for the alphabet $\mathcal{A} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$ and works with this.
\end{parag}
\begin{parag}{Erasure Weight}
    \begin{definition}
    We define the \important{erasure weigh} $p$ (resp, \important{error weight $p$}) as the total number of erasures (resp. errors).
    \end{definition}
    
    For example if we take the erasure channel from before, $p= 2$.
\end{parag}
\begin{parag}{Channel coding to deal with erasures}
    Here this is the beginning of every algorithm for channel coding which goes:\\
    Suppose that the source outputs $2$ bits, and we store them as is (no channel coding):
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=1.2]{22025-04-29.png}
    
\end{center}
f any bit is erased, there is no way to determine the original message (all hypothese are equally possible).\\
So the goal here is the put redundancy, the goal is the create a redundancy that match exactly the message. The reduncancy serves to deal with the back eyes (i don't rembeber).\\
So first we got rid of redundancy, we encrypt, and the finaly we add back in redundancy (which is not the same as the one we got rid off).
